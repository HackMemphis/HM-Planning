Marketing Plan

A space to put ideas for how we can spread the word.

This is the section where I shamelessly steal ideas from Hack Nashville
* This is what they have on their twitter:
  * By coders for coders! Build awesome stuff over 48 uninterrupted hours. Food, booze, and bandwidth are covered.
* This is on their website:
  * Eat sleep hack (sleep is crossed out)  
* They have a "Built at HackNashville" badge that you can put on a project.

People to contact: (please add URLs)
* HackNashville (@hacknashville)
