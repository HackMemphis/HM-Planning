__Tagline__  
Make Tech Happen  

__Mission__  
To bring together local tech communities to develop hardware and software projects in Memphis.  
  
__Elevator Pitch__  
HackMemphis is an ecosystem to host a hardware and software developer weekend to forge a community of hackers and makers in Memphis.  
  

__Branding__  
HACKmemphis -- The correct format for HACKmemphis is for hack to be all in capitals and Memphis to be all lower-case.  
We'll have a logo to download soon  

A space to put ideas for how we can spread the word.

This is the section where I shamelessly steal ideas from Hack Nashville
* This is what they have on their twitter:
  * By coders for coders! Build awesome stuff over 48 uninterrupted hours. Food, booze, and bandwidth are covered.
* This is on their website:
  * Eat sleep hack (sleep is crossed out)  
* They have a "Built at HackNashville" badge that you can put on a project.
