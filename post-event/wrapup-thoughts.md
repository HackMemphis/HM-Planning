## Prep For Next Time
* We are incorporating the Hack Memphis name as a mutual non-profit with in the state of TN
** See the Makers details for template to follow
* Obtain an EIN and get a bank account open
* Roughly meetings every 2 months during off season and even more regular during prep time

## Things We Did Right
* Registration went very smoothly
* Idea board was a big success
* Logisitcs - Moving stuff in and out of the location
* Provided a good atmosphere to bring developers together to work on projects
* No one got stuck on a problem they couldn't resolve (that we know of)
* No one went hungry/thirsty
* Lunch & Dinner options seemed to be agreeable with everyone
* Setup and breakdown went very well - plenty of volunteers and staff
* Staging stuff at a nearby location worked out really well for loadin

## Things We Did Wrong
* Check "best by" dates on food - we should have bought them the week of the event, not the week before
* Buy fewer drinks initially - have volunteers to run for more if needed
* Fewer snacks while being aware of attendance
* We can always do a little more planning
* Thoughts/ideas/input on what projects may have been done next time

## Ideas For the Future
### Badges
* Watch out for information overload on the badges
** Possibly using color coded details for things like types of interests
* Collect details on interest type before hand

### Projects
* Demo projects - a few hardware a few software
** Use as a potential for teaching some details for equipment that might be there

### Lead Up to Event
* Classes 2 to 4 months before hand for how to's and teaching on hardware and software projects
** There are sets of things that we know people will be using, we can make sure to offer at least those
** Hardware Side
*** Likely the Makers can help contribute the most to that section
** Software Side
*** Look to Geek Memphis
