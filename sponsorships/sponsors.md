  * Contact name, phone, and email

  * Paypal (ask Sponsorship Coordinator)
  * Check made out to "Midsouth Makers"
  * DOn't forget any extras!
* If Gold or Diamond...
  * Will they be reserving time at the sponsor table?
    * If so, check schedule in this folder
    * Clear any display with the Sponsorship Coordinator
  * Do they want time at the event for an anouncement or brief presentation?
    * If so, schedule a time with the Sponsorship Coordinator

    * If so, must collect additional $1,000 - coordinate with the Sponsorship Coordinator
  * Do they want to hang a banner at the event?
