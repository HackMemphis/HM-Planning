Sponsorship Plan
====

This is the plan for how to handle sponsorships for the HackMemphis event. It is intended to be a guide for how to handle new leads, what we can offer sponsors, what we restrictions we will have, etc. If you have any ideas on the matter, please bring them up in a planning meeting for discussion, after which those ideas can be merged into this document. Note that as this is the first time we are producing this event, we are very open to new ideas!

__NOTE: This plan - and all suggestions - are currently targeted for 40 attendees!__

* [Funding Goals](#goals)

## <a id="ideals"></a>Ideals

While we would love to have sponsors for everything in our [Funding Goals](#goals), we also want to maintain the integrity of the event and provide a comfortable, encouraging atmosphere for our attendees. To that end, there are certain things that we will encourage, and others that we will not - and some we will out right disallow.

### Recruiters

We may accept sponsorships from recruiting agencies, but we will __not__ allow recruiting during the event in any capacity. Recruiters may provide swag for the event and leave business cards on the swag table, but they may not approach attendees for the purposes of recruiting.

## <a id="goals"></a>Funding Goals

### Venue
While we are not 100% sure how long the event will last yet, nor how many people will attend, we will at least need a venue that can hold all of the attendees. This venue will need a good Internet connection, table/desk space, and chairs. The venue must also be willing to host people overnight and allow food and beverages (including alcohol) on site.

_Suggested Level: n/a_

### Beverages
While not exactly required for the event to take place, it would be great to at least have water, coffee and tea for attendees.

_Suggested Level: $100-$150_

### Beverage
There will be opportunity for a sponsor to provide both non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages. This sponsorship could come at many levels:

* __Beer__ _Suggested Level: $120-$200_
* __Soft Drinks__ (& juice, energy drinks, etc) _Suggested Level: $80-$120_

### Food
Since we want hackers to be able to stay at the event and work as long as they like without much interruption, it would be great to have food at the event.

* __Snacks__ _Suggested Level: $150-$250_
* __Demo-Day-Dinner__ _Suggested Level: $400-$500_
* __One Lunch__ _Suggested Level: $300_
* __One Breakfast__ _Suggested Level: $200-$250_

## <a id="contact-plan"></a>Contact Plan for Leads

All leads should go through a similar process in the beginning to ensure that we are hitting all of the right points, etc.
