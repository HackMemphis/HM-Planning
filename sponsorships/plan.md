Sponsorship Plan
====

This is the plan for how to handle sponsorships for the HackMemphis event. It is intended to be a guide for how to handle new leads, what we can offer sponsors, what restrictions we will have, etc. If you have any ideas on the matter, please bring them up in a planning meeting for discussion, after which those ideas can be merged into this document. Note that as this is the first time we are producing this event, we are very open to new ideas!

__NOTE: This plan - and all suggestions - are currently targeted for 40 attendees plus staff (50 total)!__

## <a id="ideals"></a>Ideals

While we would love to have sponsors for everything in our [Funding Goals](#goals), we also want to maintain the integrity of the event and provide a comfortable, encouraging atmosphere for our attendees. To that end, there are certain things that we will encourage, and others that we will not.

### Local Companies

Local companies would be preferred as it encourages and binds the developer/hacker community together, but we will not restrict our search to them.

### Exclusivity

At the highest sponsorship level a company can become an exclusive sponsor in which case we must deny sponsorship to competing companies.

### Recruiters

We will accept sponsorships from recruiting agencies, but we will __not__ allow proactive recruiting during the event in any capacity. In other words, recruiters may attend, and if approached, may engage in a dialog about recruiting the person for a position, but the recruiter may not approach other attendees without a request.

Recruiters may provide swag for the event and leave business cards on the swag table as well. At certain levels sponsors will be able to staff a table at the event for certain hours, during which recruiters may also talk to potential candidates.


## <a id="contact-plan"></a>Contact Plan for Leads

All leads should go through a similar process in the beginning to ensure that we are hitting all of the right points, etc.

## <a id="goals"></a>Funding Goals

This section will attempt to identify all of the items we will need funding for in order to plan out how many sponsors (and at what levels) we need.

### Estimate Totals

* Venvue (and Related): $____
* Food and Beverage: $____
* Other: $____
* __Grand Total: $__

### Venue

While we are not 100% sure how long the event will last yet, nor how many people will attend, we will at least need a venue that can hold all of the attendees. This venue will need power, a good Internet connection, large open space, and, if possible, tables and chairs (although with sufficient sponsorship we could rent these). The venue must also be willing to host people overnight and allow food and beverages (and possibly alcohol) on site.

If we must rent a venue, we will need funds for this. We should expect multiple thousands, depending mostly on the amount of time we need it for, the location, and the amenities.

_Estimate: $2000-$5000_

#### Tables and Chairs

If we require these items we should expect to pay around __$40-$50 per 10 people__ for two days of rental. This can vary quite a bit depending on the type of table (and chair) desired, and what company we use. Note that there is also (usually) a delivery and pick up fee.

_Estimate: $300-$400_

#### Audio and Visual

We may be able to use the projector from Midsouth Makers, but if not, we will need a screen and projector. In any case, we may also need a PA system for announcements.

* __Audio__ _Estimate: $175_
* __Visual__ _Estimate: $100_

#### Power

We may need to buy extension cords and power stips to help our attendees.

_Estimate: $100_


### Beverages
While not exactly required for the event to take place, it would be great to at least have water, coffee and tea for attendees. For two days, assuming modest consumption, we can estimate a cost of __$3 per person__.

_Estimate: $150_

#### Tasty Beverages
There will be opportunity for a sponsor to provide both non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages (beyond water, coffee, & tea).

* __Soft Drinks__ (soda, juice, energy drinks, etc) _Estimate: $100_
* __Beer__ _Estimate: $120-$250_

### Food
Since we want hackers to be able to stay at the event and work as long as they like without much interruption, it would be great to have food at the event. The numbers below are broken out by meal/food type, with a per person estimate (and total) below those.

* __Snacks__ _Estimate: $200_
* __Demo-Day Dinner__ _Estimate: $600_
* __Other Dinner__ _Estimate: $400_
* __Lunch (x2)__ _Estimate: $300_
* __Breakfast__ _Estimate: $250_
* __PER PERSON__ _Estimate: $35_
* __TOTAL (50 ppl)__ _Estimate: $1750_
