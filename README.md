HM-Planning
===========

__Welcome to the HACKmemphis.com planning repository!__

Feel free to fork this repo and make changes and issue pull requests. The idea behind using git is that we have an easy system for planning out a hack event.

File Layout:

* README.md - this file
* coordinators-and-volunteers.md - List of Coordinators and Volunteers
* event-structure.md - Potential Agendas
* groups-to-include.md - Groups we want to make sure to invite / include
* introduction.md - Brain dump
* ideals.md - Ideals / Values of the event - Things to keep in mind


_Please keep all documents in markdown format (*.md). There is a helpful [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for those new to the format - although Github does have [its own flavor](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown) of the Markdown syntax._
