HM-Planning
===========
Welcome to the Planning Git for HackMemphis. Feel free to dive in and help out! Even if you've never done anything like this before, that is perfectly fine! At one point, any of us that have done this sort of thing before had never done it either. With this kind of all-volunteer event, the only way to learn is to jump in - and assisting someone else is the best way. Is there any particular aspect you think you'd be good at? Can you write well or are  good with graphic design? Marketing anywhere always needs help in those areas. Do you arrange your life to be as efficient as possible, or have a touch of the ol' OCD? Logistics might be a good fit for you. I could go on, but the point is you have talents we can use - we all do, and figuring that out and using them to our best benefit will go a long way to making this thing a success.

Feel free to fork this repo and make changes and issue pull requests. The idea behind using git is that we have an easy system for planning out a hack event.
